**How did you get from Physics into ML?**\
ML is very much an empirical discipline, which means the we mostly learn from lots and lots of experimentation — and not just random experimentation, but hypothesis-driven experimentation, i.e. following the Scientific Method. As a Physicist, this way of thinking and making progress felt quite natural, and I decided to dig deeper. 

I took my first ML courses while still a grad student in Helsinki. When I was a postdoc at Argonne, I spent some of my personal time building a simple classification model for astronomical images, and later helped a team at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility build a deep neural net for brain image segmentation. 

Eventually I landed my first industrial job by meeting my future manager at a networking event at the University of Chicago, and became Data Scientist at JP Morgan Chase’s “Digital Intelligence” group. From there I pivoted to risk modeling at Amazon and eventually recommender systems / ranking models at Meta.

If you ever
- see a blurb “Customers like you save an average of $X a month” in your Chase app,
- get a package from Amazon that has a Dangers Goods label on it,
- see an extremely good video recommendation in your Facebook feed,

chances are I had my hands on the ML model behind it.

**Why do you write?**\
I mostly write to learn. This is also known as the Feynman technique. If you can't write it down in a paragraph, that means that you probably haven't understood it well enough yet. Besides, writing for an audience online is a great way to build a brand and create visibility for future opportunities. It's an investment.

**Do you have any tips for getting started with writing?**\
Yes! Check out my post here:\
