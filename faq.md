**How did you get from Physics into ML?**\
Today's Machine Learning is very much an empirical profession, which means that we learn simply by experimentation, using the scientific method. Much of what I've been doing as a Physicist was empirical as well, and that experience prepared me well for working in ML. However, besides the skills needed, the more important part is networking: I was lucky enough to meet my future manager from JP Morgan Chase at a networking event hosted by the University of Chicago while I was still a postdoc.

**Why do you write?**\
I mostly write to learn. This is also known as the Feynman technique. If you can't write it down in a paragraph, that means that you probably haven't understood it well enough yet. Besides, writing for an audience online is a great way to build a brand and create visibility for future opportunities. It's an investment.

**Do you have any tips for getting started with writing?**\
